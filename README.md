# Course Project - Getting and Cleaning Data

## Dependencies
This script depends on the tidyr and dplyr packages and assumes they are already installed. It does load the libraries.

## Setup

prior to performing the analysis.

The data can be retrieved from, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
